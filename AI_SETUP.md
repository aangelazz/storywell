5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

### 2. Configure Your App
1. Open `claude-ai.js`
2. Replace `'YOUR_CLAUDE_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual API key:
   ```javascript
   apiKey: 'sk-ant-your-actual-key-here',
   ```

## Cost Efficiency 💰

**Your $1000 budget will give you approximately:**
- **50,000+ stories** using Claude Haiku
- **Cost per story: ~$0.01-0.02**
- **Perfect for a hackathon demo!**

## What the AI Does ✨

1. **Preserves Medical Accuracy**: Keeps all facts exactly as the doctor said
2. **Kid-Friendly Translation**: 
   - "stethoscope" → "magic listening tool"
   - "blood pressure cuff" → "arm hugger"
   - "injection" → "tiny superhero medicine"
3. **Creates Engaging Stories**: 4-6 page adventures with illustrations
4. **Positive Messaging**: Emphasizes bravery and health heroes

## Example Transformation

**Doctor Says:**
> "We need to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart with a stethoscope. You might need a vaccination today."

**AI Creates:**
> "The health hero used a special arm hugger to see how strong my heart is! Then they used their magic listening tool to hear my heartbeat go thump-thump-thump. I got a tiny superhero medicine that will give me superpowers to fight off germy villains! I was so brave! 🦸‍♂️"

## Fallback System 🛡️

If AI fails (internet issues, API limits):
- Automatically uses local processing
- Still creates kid-friendly stories
- No interruption to user experience

## Ready to Launch! 🚀

Your app now has AI superpowers while staying within budget. Perfect for your hackathon demo!
